# Earthquake Tracker

## Overview

This web application allows a user to search for earthquake data for a specific location. The search displays a map showing the location of all returned earthquake events along with a card showing data for each event. All of this information is displayed on the page in an easy to read dashboard format. The styling of the page was done using bootstrap.
